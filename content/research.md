    <h4>Construction of a high-resolution gridded rainfall dataset for Peru from 1981 to the present day</h4>
    <p class="intro">A new gridded rainfall dataset available for Peru is introduced, called PISCOp V2.1 (Peruvian Interpolated data of SENAMHI’s Climatological and Hydrological Observations). PISCOp has been developed for the period 1981 to the present, with an average latency of eight weeks at 0.1° spatial resolution. The merging algorithm is based on geostatistical and deterministic interpolation methods including three different rainfall sources: (i) the national quality-controlled and infilled raingauge dataset, (ii) radar-gauge merged precipitation climatologies and (iii) the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation (CHIRP) estimates...</p>

    <h4>Climate and extreme events from the Central Altiplano of Peru and Bolivia</h4>
    <p class="intro">One of the most important factors for the
planned development of a country is the
knowledge of climate behavior. Due to our
topography and physiographic variability,
Bolivia presents great challenges for the
analysis of climatic patterns. To meet these
challenges, academic and governmental
institutions work hand to hand in order to
provide answers to the uncertainty in the
climatological characterization, at local and
regional level in our country....</p>
