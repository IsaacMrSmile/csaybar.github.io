This [Github repo](https://github.com/csaybar/DLcoursera) contains multiple Colab iPython notebooks which serve as tutorials for learning about deploying deep learning and machine learning models. All the material is part of the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization.

The following topics are covered:

  - **1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: In this course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. When you finish this Colabs, you will:
      - Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning.
      - Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks.
      - Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks.
      - Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture.
      
  - **2. Improving Deep Neural Networks Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization**: This course will teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, and be able to more systematically get good results. You will also learn TensorFlow. When you finish this Colabs, you will:
    
    - Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 
    - Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization and gradient checking.
    - Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence. 
    - Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance.
    - Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow. 
    
  - **4. Convolutional Neural Network**: This course will teach you how to build convolutional neural networks and apply it to image data. Thanks to deep learning, computer vision is working far better than just two years ago, and this is enabling numerous exciting applications ranging from safe autonomous driving, to accurate face recognition, to automatic reading of radiology images. 
You will:
    - Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks.
    - Know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
    - Know to use neural style transfer to generate art.
    - Be able to apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.

# 2. PISCOp: Rainfall to everyone everywhere in Peru

This [Proyect](https://piscoprec.github.io/) introduces a new gridded rainfall dataset available for Peru called PISCOp V2.1 (Peruvian Interpolated data of SENAMHI's Climatological and Hydrological Observations) that have been developed for the period 1981 to the present with an average latency of eight weeks at 0.1° spatial resolution. The merging algorithm is based on geostatistical and deterministic interpolation methods including three different rainfall sources: (i) the national quality-controlled and infilled rain gauge dataset, ii) radar-gauge merged precipitation climatologies and (iii) the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation (CHIRP) estimates. The validation results suggest that precipitation estimates are acceptable showing the highest performance for the Pacific coast and the western flank of the Andes. Furthermore, a meticulous quality-control and gap-infilling procedure allowed to reduce the formation of inhomogeneities (non-climatic breaks). The dataset is publicly available at https://piscoprec.github.io/ and is intended to support hydrological studies and water management practices.
