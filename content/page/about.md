Looking back ~5 years ago, there was one thing which diversified my thoughts and changes the course of my career: Discover Linux and installs Debian Wheezy on my old computer (a Pentium 4). After that one thing led to another.

I am passionate about data that nowadays works at SENAMHI solving complex problems, always in the best possible way. When I'm not in the office coding or writing reports. I am playing the violin (although without much success â€¦ for now!), traveling around Peru or reading about Reproducible Research and AI.
