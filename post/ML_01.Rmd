**Today** I'm going to start a series of **10 posts**, *one for every week from today*, about the most popular Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) clasification algorithms.

[Classification algorithms](https://medium.com/@sifium/machine-learning-types-of-classification-9497bd4f2e14), in a nutshell, give you the possibility to assign a label for each element of your dataset. Even though this action would seem unimportant, there are a lot of real-world applications:

  - Cancer diagnosis.
  - Deforestation.
  - Email spam detection.
  - Speech recognition.
  - Etc.

These post series do not intend to be a formal ML course, but rather, help you to **open the black box** and teach you to implement and understand the algorithms correctly. For an easy lecture, all post are going to be written using the same structure:

  - **1. Intro:**: A simple explanation.
  - **2. Preprocessing:** Wrangling your data for success.
  - **3. From Scratch:** Let's take a look at how the algorithm works.
  - **4. Implementation using [keras](https://keras.io/):** A high-level API build on TensorFlow (It will make your life easy).
  - **5. Implementation using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=en):** An open source software library for numerical computation using data-flow graphs.

All post will be written using the R package [knirt](https://yihui.name/knitr/). Also, all the tables and static and dynamic visualizations are building using R too. While the main objective of this serie of tutorials is generate a in-deep knowledge about how really work the ML algorithms. Additionally, I aims to teach you the basic steps to integrate the best of both python (machine learning libraries) and R (tidyverse) into the same workflow.

Note: You need install Rstudio with a version > 1.2 for carry out the python + R integration.

## 1. Intro:
If you have been studying statistic for a long time (like me), probably you feel at home using **Logistic Regression**. It is a the prefereable algorithm to initialize new students in the field of Machine Learning due its simplicity.

- **Activation Function:** 

$$\hat{y}^{(i)} = a^{(i)} = sigmoid(z^{(i)})\tag{1}$$ 

$$z^{(i)} = w^T x^{(i)} + b \tag{2}$$

$$sigmoid(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\tag{3}$$


- **Decision Boundary:** 

$$\hat{y}^{(i)} < 0.5\tag{4};\ case\_01$$

$$\hat{y}^{(i)} >= 0.5;\ case\_02 \tag{5}$$

- **Loss(Error) Function:** [Cross Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy)

$$ \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) =  - y^{(i)}  \log(a^{(i)}) - (1-y^{(i)} )  \log(1-a^{(i)})\tag{6}$$

- **Cost Function:** 

$$ J = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\tag{7}$$

**You will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat**.

## 2. Preprocessing

The R + python integration in Rstudio is absurdly easy you only need run the following:

```{r setup}
library(reticulate)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE,warning = F,message = F)
use_python("/usr/bin/python3")
```

Before coding do not forget install and load the following libraries.

**For python:**

```{python pylib, results='hide'}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import h5py
import scipy
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from PIL import Image
from scipy import ndimage
import urllib
```

**For R:**

```{r rlibs, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(raster)
```

#### Downloading the cats dataset  (=ↀωↀ=)

![](../../img/cats.png)

You are given a dataset (cats.h5) containing:

  - **x_info:** a training set with 259 images, each image is of shape 64x64x3 where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB).
  - **y_info:** array labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0).

```{python, results='hide'}
cat_database = 'https://github.com/csaybar/DLdatasets/raw/master/cats.hdf5'
urllib.request.urlretrieve(cat_database, 'cats.h5')
```

#### Train/Test split (from hdf5 to numpy)

```{python}

def load_dataset(test_size = 0.3):
  """
  This function convert the cats.h5 dataset in a test and training numpy array.

  Argument:
  test_size -- If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion of the dataset to include in the test split.
"""
  train_dataset = h5py.File('cats.h5', "r")
  train_set_x = np.array(train_dataset['x_info'])
  train_set_y = np.array(train_dataset['y_info'])
  classes = np.array(train_dataset["list_classes"]) 
  tr_x, tst_x, tr_y, tst_y = train_test_split(train_set_x,train_set_y,test_size = test_size)
  return tr_x, tr_y, tst_x, tst_y, classes

train_set_x, train_set_y, test_set_x, test_set_y, classes = load_dataset()
```

### Is it a cat-picture?

```{r}
img = 1
image = brick(py$train_set_x[img,,,])
name = py$train_set_y[img]
if (name) {
  message = 'This is a cat'
} else {
  message = 'This is not a cat'
}

original_par <-par() #original par
par(col.axis="white",col.lab="white",tck=0)
plotRGB(image,axes = TRUE, main = message)
box(col="white")
```

## 3. Logistic Regression from Scratch

#### 3.1 Activation function

```{python}
def sigmoid(z):
    """
    Compute the sigmoid of z

    Arguments:
    z -- A scalar or numpy array of any size.

    Return:
    s -- sigmoid(z)
    """

    s = 1 /(1 + np.exp(-z))
    
    return s
```

#### 3.2 Initializing parameters

```{python}
def initialize_with_zeros(dim):
    """
    This function creates a vector of zeros of shape (dim, 1) for w and initializes b to 0.
    
    Argument:
    dim -- size of the w vector we want (or number of parameters in this case)
    
    Returns:
    w -- initialized vector of shape (dim, 1)
    b -- initialized scalar (corresponds to the bias)
    """
    
    w = np.zeros(shape=(dim, 1), dtype=np.float32)
    b = 0
    return w, b
```


#### 3.2  Forward and Backward propagation

Now that your parameters are initialized, you can do the "forward" and "backward" propagation steps for learning the parameters.

**Exercise:** Implement a function `propagate()` that computes the cost function and its gradient.

**Hints**:

Forward Propagation:
- You get X
- You compute $A = \sigma(w^T X + b) = (a^{(1)}, a^{(2)}, ..., a^{(m-1)}, a^{(m)})$
- You calculate the cost function: $J = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}y^{(i)}\log(a^{(i)})+(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-a^{(i)})$

Here are the two formulas you will be using: 

$$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m}X(A-Y)^T\tag{7}$$
$$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (a^{(i)}-y^{(i)})\tag{8}$$

```{python}
def propagate(w, b, X, Y):
    """
    Implement the cost function and its gradient for the propagation explained above

    Arguments:
    w -- weights, a numpy array of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
    b -- bias, a scalar
    X -- data of size (num_px * num_px * 3, number of examples)
    Y -- true "label" vector (containing 0 if non-cat, 1 if cat) of size (1, number of examples)

    Return:
    cost -- negative log-likelihood cost for logistic regression
    dw -- gradient of the loss with respect to w, thus same shape as w
    db -- gradient of the loss with respect to b, thus same shape as b
    
    Tips:
    - Write your code step by step for the propagation. np.log(), np.dot()
    """
    
    m = X.shape[1]
    
    # FORWARD PROPAGATION (FROM X TO COST)
    A = sigmoid(np.dot(w.T, X) + b)             # compute activation
    cost = (-1. / m) * np.sum((Y*np.log(A) + (1 - Y)*np.log(1-A)), axis=1)    # compute cost
    
    # BACKWARD PROPAGATION (TO FIND GRAD)
    dw = (1./m)*np.dot(X,((A-Y).T))
    db = (1./m)*np.sum(A-Y, axis=1)
    
    cost = np.squeeze(cost)
    
    grads = {"dw": dw,
             "db": db}
    
    return grads, cost
```

#### 3.3 - Optimization

- You have initialized your parameters.
- You are also able to compute a cost function and its gradient.
- Now, you want to update the parameters using gradient descent.

**Exercise:** Write down the optimization function. The goal is to learn $w$ and $b$ by minimizing the cost function $J$. For a parameter $\theta$, the update rule is $ \theta = \theta - \alpha \text{ } d\theta$, where $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

```{python}
def optimize(w, b, X, Y, num_iterations, learning_rate, print_cost = False):
    """
    This function optimizes w and b by running a gradient descent algorithm
    
    Arguments:
    w -- weights, a numpy array of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
    b -- bias, a scalar
    X -- data of shape (num_px * num_px * 3, number of examples)
    Y -- true "label" vector (containing 0 if non-cat, 1 if cat), of shape (1, number of examples)
    num_iterations -- number of iterations of the optimization loop
    learning_rate -- learning rate of the gradient descent update rule
    print_cost -- True to print the loss every 100 steps
    
    Returns:
    params -- dictionary containing the weights w and bias b
    grads -- dictionary containing the gradients of the weights and bias with respect to the cost function
    costs -- list of all the costs computed during the optimization, this will be used to plot the learning curve.
    
    Tips:
    You basically need to write down two steps and iterate through them:
        1) Calculate the cost and the gradient for the current parameters. Use propagate().
        2) Update the parameters using gradient descent rule for w and b.
    """
    
    costs = []
    
    for i in range(num_iterations):
        
        # Cost and gradient calculation (≈ 1-4 lines of code)
        grads, cost = propagate(w=w, b=b, X=X, Y=Y)
        
        # Retrieve derivatives from grads
        dw = grads["dw"]
        db = grads["db"]
        
        # update rule (≈ 2 lines of code)
        w = w - learning_rate*dw
        b = b - learning_rate*db
        
        # Record the costs
        if i % 100 == 0:
            costs.append(cost)
        
        # Print the cost every 100 training iterations
        if print_cost and i % 100 == 0:
            print ("Cost after iteration %i: %f" %(i, cost))
    
    params = {"w": w,
              "b": b}
    
    grads = {"dw": dw,
             "db": db}
    
    return params, grads, costs
```

    
#### 3.4 - Prediction

```{python}
def predict(w, b, X):
    '''
    Predict whether the label is 0 or 1 using learned logistic regression parameters (w, b)
    
    Arguments:
    w -- weights, a numpy array of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
    b -- bias, a scalar
    X -- data of size (num_px * num_px * 3, number of examples)
    
    Returns:
    Y_prediction -- a numpy array (vector) containing all predictions (0/1) for the examples in X
    '''
    
    m = X.shape[1]
    Y_prediction = np.zeros((1,m))
    w = w.reshape(X.shape[0], 1)
    
    # Compute vector "A" predicting the probabilities of a cat being present in the picture
    ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 1 line of code)
    A = sigmoid(np.dot(w.T, X) + b)
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    for i in range(A.shape[1]):
        
        # Convert probabilities A[0,i] to actual predictions p[0,i]
        ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 4 lines of code)
        if A[0, i] >= 0.5:
            Y_prediction[0, i] = 1
            
        else:
            Y_prediction[0, i] = 0
        ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    assert(Y_prediction.shape == (1, m))
    
    return Y_prediction
```

#### 3.5 - Model
